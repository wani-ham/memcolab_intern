### Background

* "Sensory recruitment" hypothesis


### Methods

* MVPA (Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis)
  * d

### Results

* Decoding maintained representation
  * The ability to maintain representations appears to be a general property of visual cortex
  * Ex: Harrison & Tong (2009)
    * Participants had to remeber whether the stimuli was clockwise or anti-clockwise after 11s of delay
    * During the delay period, the patterns of BOLD response in **early visual cortex (V1-V4)** could be used to decode the orientation of the grating held in memory
    * Suggest that <ins>early visual cortex holds a specific representation of the maintained orientation</ins>
  * But there are other results that this ability is not limited to visual cortex -> it may be that any particular cortical region can be recruited for maintenance, depending on the nature of the information maintained

* Limitations of multivoxel decoding
  1. Although MVPA can provide evidence that there are distinct representations during visual working memory, it does not indicate what the nature of those representations are
  2. the success of MVPA depends on the spatial arrangement of responses across voxels and may require the presence of large-scale maps
     * The failure to find decoding for particular information in a given region could simply reflect heterogeneous organization of that information across the cortex rather than its absence

* Relationship to non-human primate studies
  * 

* Relationship to visual mental imagery


### Discussion

* There may not be a sharp divide between regions involved in maintenance and regions involved in representing these aspects of task performance, but that these functions can co-exist in the same regions.
