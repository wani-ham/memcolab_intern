# Multi-Voxel Decoding and the Topography of Maintained Information During Visual Working Memory

* **Date** : 2016
* **Keywords** : *working memory, short term moemory, multivoxel pattern analysis(MVPA), visual imagery, visual working memory*

### Background

* The neural basis of visual working memory was controversial 
  * V1, middle temporal area (MT), parietal, temporal and prefrontal cortices etc...
* "Sensory recruitment" hypothesis
  * Information is maintained in sensory regions during visual working memory 


### Methods

* MVPA (Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis)
  * d

### Results

* Decoding maintained representation
  * The ability to maintain representations appears to be a general property of visual cortex
  * Ex: Harrison & Tong (2009)
    * Participants had to remeber whether the stimuli was clockwise or anti-clockwise after 11s of delay
    * During the delay period, the patterns of BOLD response in **early visual cortex (V1-V4)** could be used to decode the orientation of the grating held in memory
    * Suggest that <ins>early visual cortex holds a specific representation of the maintained orientation</ins>
  * But there are other results that this ability is not limited to visual cortex -> it may be that any particular cortical region can be recruited for maintenance, depending on the nature of the information maintained

* Limitations of multivoxel decoding
  1. Although MVPA can provide evidence that there are distinct representations during visual working memory, it does not indicate what the nature of those representations are
  2. the success of MVPA depends on the spatial arrangement of responses across voxels and may require the presence of large-scale maps
     * The failure to find decoding for particular information in a given region could simply reflect heterogeneous organization of that information across the cortex rather than its absence

* Relationship to non-human primate studies
  * There is only limited evidence for maintained signals in non-human primate V1 and MT
  * While non-human primate studies have often reported stimulus-selective sustained activity in prefrontal cortex, some fMRI  decoding studies have failed to find evidence for maintained representations in human prefrontal cortex 
*  The single unit neurophysiology data from non-human primate prefrontal cortex may be more associated with attentional signals than stimulus properties, while the multivoxel decoding data in
human posterior cortex primarily reflects maintained sensory
representations. 


* Relationship to visual mental imagery
  * Visual working memory and visual mental imagery may be highly related
    * V1-V3 they could decode orientation during the delay on both working memory and mental imagery trials (Albers et al. (2013))

  * Visual working memory and visual mental imagery is a dissociable processes
    * This dissociation may not reflect the different nature of signals for maintenance between imagery and working memory but interference effect between bottom-up visual inputs


### Discussion

* There may not be a sharp divide between regions involved in maintenance and regions involved in representing these aspects of task performance, but that these functions can co-exist in the same regions.
