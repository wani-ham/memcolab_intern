# Multi-Voxel Decoding and the Topography of Maintained Information During Visual Working Memory

* **Date** : 2016
* **Keywords** : *working memory, short term moemory, multivoxel pattern analysis(MVPA), visual imagery, visual working memory*

### Background

* "Sensory recruitment" hypothesis


### Methods

* MVPA (Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis)
  * d

### Results

* Decoding maintained representation
  * Harrison & Tong (2009)
    * Participants had to remeber whether the stimuli was clockwise or anti-clockwise after 11s of delay
    * During the delay period, the patterns of BOLD response in **early visual cortex (V1-V4)** could be used to decode the orientation of the grating held in memory
    * Suggest that <ins>early visual cortex holds a specific representation of the maintained orientation</ins>
