# On the Perception of Probable Things: Neural Substrates of Associative Memory, Imagery, and Perception

* Date : 2012
* Keywords : *A, B, C*

### Background
* Prior knowledge of the world is believed to be manifested as ‘top-down’ neuronal signals that influence the processing of ‘bottom-up’ sensory information arising from the retina.

* This paper is going to review...
  1) Neuronal changes that parallel the acquisition of long-term memories of associations between visual stimuli, such as between a knife and fork or a train and its track. 
  2) Neuronal events that correspond to memories recalled via such learned associations and the relationship of this recall to the phenomenon of visual imagery.

* A Neuronal Foundation for Associative Learning
    * Hypothesis by William James (1890): the behavioral learning of an association between two stimuli is accomplished by the establishment or strengthening of a functional connection between the neuronal representations of the associated stimuli.
    * The predicted neuronal signature of associative learning in visual cortex is a convergence of response magnitudes—as A and B become associated, neurons initially responding selectively to one or the other of these stimuli will generalize to the associated stimulus. 
* Neural Correlates of Visual Associative Learning

  * The emergence of pair-coding responses in IT cortex supports the conclusion that learning strengthens connectivity between the relevant neuronal representations.
