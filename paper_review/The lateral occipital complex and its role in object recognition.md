# The lateral occipital complex and its role in object recognition

* Date : 2001
* Keywords : *Object recognition, LOC(lateral occipital complex)*

### Background

* How is human capable of high accuracy-fast object recognition?
  * fMRI researches in mapping the brain regions involved in early and mid-level stages of visual information processing
  * Malach et al. (1995) : **LOC (lateral occipital complex)** responds more strongly when subjects passively view photographs of common everyday objects than when they view visual textures without obvious shape interpretations

### Methods

### Results

* Mapping object-selective visual areas in the human cortex

* Cue invariance in the LOC
  * Some evidence suggests that some regions within LO might exhibit not only cue invariance, but also modality-invariance
  * LOC is involved in the representation of shapes rather than the physical properties or local features in the visual stimulus
  
* Does the LOC represent contours or shapes?
  * Neural populations in the LOC are involved in processing the shape of objects rather than low level contours

* Is information about the 3-D structure of objects processed in the LOC?
  * Increased neural activity in the LOC has been shown when images of objects are perceived as 3D volumes rather than as 2D shapes
  * However, other studies (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000a,b; Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2000) suggest that the LOC is not specifically involved in extracting depth information. 
  * Further studies are required

* Invariances versus sensitivities to object transformations in the LOC


* From representation to object recognition

* Category specific regions of cortex


### Discussion

* LOC appears to be a kind of general-purpose system for analyzing object shape, in contrast to other cortical regions such as the FFA and PPA that are more selectively engaged by particular stimulus classes. 

* Suggest that object recognition is accomplished by the operation of both category-specific and general-purpose mechanisms
