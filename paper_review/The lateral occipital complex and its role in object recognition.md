# The lateral occipital complex and its role in object recognition

* Date : 2001
* Keywords : *Object recognition, LOC(lateral occipital complex)*

### Background

* How is human capable of high accuracy-fast object recognition?
  * fMRI researches in mapping the brain regions involved in early and mid-level stages of visual information processing
  * Malach et al. (1995) : **LOC (lateral occipital complex)** responds more strongly when subjects passively view photographs of common everyday objects than when they view visual textures without obvious shape interpretations

### Methods


### Results

* Mapping object-selective visual areas in the human cortex
  * However, another recent study (Lerner, Hendler, Harel, & Malach, 2001) suggests that the <ins>LOC may be functionally segregated along an anterior-posterior axis, beginning in retinotopic regions (V4/V8) and continuing into the LOC.</ins>
  * In addition to LO and pFs/LOa, many experiments reveal additional object-selective regions in the <ins>dorsal visual pathway</ins> (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982) <ins>Dorsal object-selective foci</ins> (Grill-Spector et al., 1998a GrillSpector et al., 1998b Grill-Spector et al., 2000) include <ins>regions that may be partially overlapping V3a, extending into an area immediately anterior to it, possibly V7</ins> (Tootell et al., 1998a). 
* Cue invariance in the LOC
  * Some evidence suggests that some regions within LO might exhibit not only cue invariance, but also modality-invariance
  * LOC is involved in the representation of shapes rather than the physical properties or local features in the visual stimulus
  
* Does the LOC represent contours or shapes?
  * Neural populations in the LOC are involved in processing the shape of objects rather than low level contours

* Is information about the 3-D structure of objects processed in the LOC?
  * Increased neural activity in the LOC has been shown when images of objects are perceived as 3D volumes rather than as 2D shapes
  * However, other studies (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000a,b; Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2000) suggest that the LOC is not specifically involved in extracting depth information. 
  * Further studies are required

* Invariances versus sensitivities to object transformations in the LOC
  * Some theories (e.g. Biederman, 1987) suggest a 3D object-centered representation, while other theories posit that multiple 2D views of an object span its representation (e.g. Poggio & Edelman, 1990; Ullman, 1996; Edelman & Duvdevani-Bar, 1997).
  * if different neurons encode the same object at different locations, then changing the position of the stimulus in the visual field would prevent adaptation
  * these neuronal invariances to changes in size and position should be contrasted with the high degree of shape selectivity in LOC revealed by the relative lack of adaptation in the blocks where objects from the same basic category (i.e. cars or faces) were presented under identical viewing condition (but see Koutstaal et al., 2001, who suggest that there are some occipito-temporal regions that are also adapted by primed but not identical pictures of the same semantic category).

* From representation to object recognition
  * Results suggest a clear correlation between subjectsâ€™ recognition performance and selective activation in human object-selective areas
  * Recognition is not the only factor that determines activity in these areas. Additional factors can modulate the amplitude of fMRI activation even when recognition is maintained.
    * EX: fMR-adaptation, attention

* Category specific regions of cortex
  * What is the nature of these category-selective regions(FFA(Fusiform Face Area), PPA(Parahippocampal Place Area)) of cortex and how are they related functionally and anatomically to the LOC?
  

### Discussion

* LOC appears to be a kind of general-purpose system for analyzing object shape, in contrast to other cortical regions such as the FFA and PPA that are more selectively engaged by particular stimulus classes. 

* Suggest that object recognition is accomplished by the operation of both category-specific and general-purpose mechanisms
