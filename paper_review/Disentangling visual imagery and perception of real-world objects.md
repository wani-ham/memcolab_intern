# Disentangling visual imagery and perception of real-world objects

* Date : 2011
* Keywords : *object recognition, perception, mental imagery*

### Background
* **Seen objects** and **Imagined objects**
  * Similarity 
    * The global pattern of brain activation in both imagery and perception is very similar
    * Research suggesting overlap in representation evoked during imagery and perception
  * Difference
    * Brain-damaged patients indicates that imagery and perception can be dissociated
  * So what differentiates the utilization of the tissue by the two processes (**Perception** and **Imagery**) along the ventral visual pathway?

### Methods
* Pre-scan training : Participants were familiarized with the ten object images and practiced generating vivid mental images

* fMRI Experiment

* Localizer design
    * Object-selective regions : LO(lateral occipital), pFs(posterior fusiform)
    * Retinotopic : V1, ES(extrastriate cortex: V3, V4, V5/MT)

### Results
* Response magnitude
  * Perception : strong responses in all ROIs.
  * Imagery : (1) Much smaller average response + Only ES showed significantly greater than zero / (2) Opposite pattern of response in object-selective compared to perception (retinotopic < object-selective)
