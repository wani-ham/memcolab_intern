# Disentangling visual imagery and perception of real-world objects

* Date : 2011
* Keywords : *object recognition, perception, mental imagery*

### Background
* **Seen objects** and **Imagined objects**
  * Similarity 
    * The global pattern of brain activation in both imagery and perception is very similar
    * Research suggesting overlap in representation evoked during imagery and perception
  * Difference
    * Brain-damaged patients indicates that imagery and perception can be dissociated
  * So what differentiates the utilization of the tissue by the two processes (**Perception** and **Imagery**) along the ventral visual pathway?
